# OCA-Task-1-Wireframe-Mockup
This project includes wireframe and mockup designs for a personal website, created in Figma. The wireframe shows the homepage layout with five sections: header, hero, about, services, and footer. The mockup adds color, fonts, and images, offering a realistic view of the final design, demonstrating UI/UX design skills.
